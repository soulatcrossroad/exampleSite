      <description>“For with you is the fountain of light; in your light, we see light.” (Psalm 36:9)
My most persistent fear of finding God is what He will make me do. My fear was that He will compel me to do something against my will, and I will have no choice but to do it. I saw all those missionaries as unfortunate people; there is no way anyone would choose to do that willingly.</description>

      <description>Grace is a word I’ve been especially interested in. I always ask for graces, but I don’t really know what I’m asking for. I have been told that God has given me many graces, but I don’t know what, where or how I’m supposed to know this is so if I cannot see, feel or touch it. The Greek word for grace translates to “release of loveliness...”. But beautiful as the sound and the corresponding images this translation evokes are, I couldn&#39;t comprehend.</description>
