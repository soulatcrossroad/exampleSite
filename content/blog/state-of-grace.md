<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:"Bodoni Bd BT",serif;'><i>“work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure”</i>
                        (Philippians 2:12-13)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                        <p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>I was reading
another <a href = "http://phatcatholic.blogspot.com/2014/10/what-is-grace-of-final-perseverance.html">blog</a> and I got to thinking maybe I should write my own Conversion Story too.
<b>This</b> is not the story, but I can tell you that it involved two main ingredients
that I did not know about then and only realise now in hindsight.  The first ingredient
is Grace. The second is State of Grace. Up until this moment that I write, I
never realised this fact. It’s a jolt to my senses to put <i>Grace</i> and <i>State
of Grace</i> side by side, because until now, I have never attempted to give a
name or description to what was going on with me at that time; I wouldn’t have
been able to. But as I look back now, I wonder if the
phrase, <span style='font-size:14.0pt; line-height:107%;font-family:"Bodoni Bd BT",serif;'>“<i>that the cause of our downfall might become the means of our salvation,</i>”</span> from the preface of the Eucharistic Prayer for Sundays III might just apply. </span></p>

                        <p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>At the time
when both ingredients were in action, I was sure that I was committing another mortal sin. It is an arguably fact whether I was or wasn't. But I was so far gone in numbness and my thinking at that time was, “<i>What is another mortal sin when I’m already drowning in one already?</i>” But I get ahead of myself. Let’s start from the beginning.</span></p>

                        <p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>From the time
I started receiving the Holy Eucharist, I have only understood <i>State of
Grace</i> to be something that prevents people from receiving. I wasn’t sure
exactly what that something was, but my initial solution was to put on a very
serious face anytime I went to receive hoping that I was fulfilling the
requirements for the state; as if I could frighten God into believing I was in
a state of grace. As I got older, I began to understand it to mean the state in
which one is without sin. This was more meaningful, but didn’t change its job description;
it still keeps people away. </span></p>

                        <p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>When I finally
became aware of the dire warning attached to receiving when not in a state of
grace – eternal condemnation, sure place in hell – I was always in a state of mild
panic anytime I had to receive. I think the internal battle – in-state or out-of-state – wore me out and with my life beginning to go down the drain, I stopped receiving. I couldn’t stand all the guilt and uncertainty with something so Sacred and so, I abstained. During the period of abstaining, I fell... -  <i>drifted</i> is a better word - I drifted into mortal sin. I had been dying slowly until I was dead. Numb
with no feelings. I didn’t see the side blow that was coming for me while I was proud of myself that I had dodged a direct face punch. I drifted and I was 100 percent certain I shouldn’t go for Holy Communion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

                        <p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The only
prayer I remember making was that God should not take away my sense of obligation of coming to Mass every Sunday; that has always been my earnest prayer, “…just keep me coming to Church, if nothing else”.</p>

                        <p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>After a long while, alone with myself, something began to
nag me. It said that since I was sure I had one sin to confess, I should go to
confess it. My excuse for not going to confession for more than 3 years was
that I didn’t feel like I had committed any sin. But now I that I was sure,
what excuse did I have? But I was too ashamed to go. Unfortunately for me,
another desire started to blossom; I wanted to go back to receiving the Holy
Eucharist.</span></p>


<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Looks like my
problems were back. <i>State of Grace</i>!!! No way was I going to confess, but
here I was with a strong desire to receive.  Therefore, the question I asked at
the beginning finds its context, <i>“What is another mortal sin when I’m
already drowning in one already?”</i> I couldn’t get my feet to move to the
Confessional. But while it was hard to leave my house to come for Confession,
it was easier to come for Mass. So, I took a risk. I gambled with my soul. I decided
to go for Holy Communion anyway.</span></p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>I was acutely aware I
could die, and it took many Sundays to
resolve that this would be <i>the Sunday</i> I will go. Only thing I told God, in my mind<i>“let this Communion I receive be the inspiration
for me to go for Confession. I want to go, but I can’t, and I want to receive.
So, I am going to receive, but you have to let this Communion bring life to me
not death”</i>.  

I was sort of hoping for something dramatic to announce that God has answered my prayers or was angry with me. Something; anything. But, nothing. So, I decided to try the Confessional.

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>So, what about
my law-breaking? Receiving in a state of mortal sin? Wait for it… It looks like
for the first time in my life, I was actually receiving in a State of Grace!!! Or
rather, I should say, this is the only period of my life that I am sure I was
in a state of Grace. </p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>State of Grace
is the state where you are <b>truly aware</b> that you are a sinner in the need
of God’s mercy and that it is<b> only</b> Jesus that can save you. It’s not so
much as whether you are in sin or out of it – <i>of course you must be making
serious and conscious effort to be out of it </i>– but that you are truly aware
that your whole nature is sinful – <i>regardless of whether you have gone for
Confession or not</i> – and you are truly repentant – <i>repentant meaning you
don’t want to do it again even if you don’t know how to stop</i> – and you are
aware that the source of life and grace is what you are receiving to strengthen
you –<i> not in the way you are expecting so you have to keep an open mind and
just focus on your desire to change</i>. </p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>How I came to
be sure of this is that, even though I did confess to receiving in a state of
mortal sin, I still felt guilty; the only difference was that I wasn’t going to
let it stop me this time. After all this effort, no way! So, I still kept questioning
why the strategy worked; what made a difference between receiving life and
death. And I am only realising <b>now</b> that it was this disposition; I had unwittingly
acknowledged the Eucharist to be God and the source of life to revive my sorry
state which I had also acknowledged, and I believed that He will save me. Even
if He didn’t manifest in fire and thunder as I wished, He got the job done.</p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>And that nagging,
or rather subtle but persistent, voice was Grace. The motivation was that I couldn’t
be deader than dead, so might as well try for the thing that gives life, and if
I die, well, I was already dead anyway. On my own, without that thought, I will
never have gotten the idea or the courage to go forward. I’m not that brave or
daring. And there have still been hiccups between this time and now, but nothing
as major as this period in my life, but all of them still needing whispers of
Grace. </span></p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>Now I truly understand
when they say the Holy Eucharist is not for the perfect, it’s for the sinners;
the remedy of all ills. I look back and I see how amazing it all is. Grace and
State of Grace. A cycle. You receive motivation which puts you in a position to
receive more motivation because only when you acknowledge yourself to be
nothing that God lifts you up.  </span></p>

It is one thing to receive the Holy Eucharist
when you are <i>unsure</i> of what state you are in, but when you are <i>sure</i>
you are in a state of mortal sin, I don’t think you should attempt it. </span></p>

<p  style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>State of Grace
is no longer a reason to stay away, it is the very reason to go forward in all
boldness. Preventing people is not its job description. The question being
posed is, “are you a sinner in need of mercy and believe that this, which you
receive, is God; Jesus Christ Himself, and He can save you?”. And in all
gladness, I can shout, “Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!” and go and receive now. </span></p>
